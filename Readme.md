When given a calculation like A^B mod C, computing the value causes difficulty due to the large number incorporated with the program. This led to the development of modular exponentiation, which allows a more efficient calculation procedure for this situation. This is a C program that implements the manual method of modular exponentiation given a user defined set of variables. This program does not use the recursive method as I wished to explore the functions and challenges in the non-recursive method. As the program is written in C, even then the numbers have a limit, which is an issue I face in this program.
